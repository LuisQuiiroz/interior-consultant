- Where can I see your demo?
  
  [Here](https://interior-consultant-q.netlify.app/)
  
- What was your experience?

   The design is a very important part, since with it you have to attract the user. The bigger an application is, the more design is needed and this can lead to frustration due to not being able to display the content as desired.
  
- What have you learned/improved?

   You have to take into account the screen resolutions when you are doing the design, since not doing so can bring undesired results and we do not want the user to have a bad experience when visiting our website.
Another important thing is that the more difficult the design of a page becomes, it is better to look for other alternatives that help or facilitate the design, it is not necessary to reinvent the wheel.

- Your wisdom? :)

  Everything is possible with patience and creativity
